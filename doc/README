Copyright (c) 2011-2016 Bitcoin Developers
Distributed under the MIT/X11 software license, see the accompanying
file license.txt or http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.
This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in
the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).  This product includes
cryptographic software written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).


Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/bitcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/bitcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Bitcoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Bitcoin network.


Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.4, first backup wallet
bitcoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>

bitcoind stop
Uninstall v0.4 client, download and install v0.5 client.
Start up the new bitcoind (0.5.4).
If upgrade is performed after or close to upgrade deadline then blockchain
re-download is required.

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
